# Installing GKE plugin on Jenkins running in Kubernetes

This document provides guidance on how to configure Jenkins running within
Kubernetes in order to meet the plugin's pre-requisites, namely that the
`kubectl` binary be installed on the agent container.

## Installing on an existing Jenkins installation with Kubernetes Cloud

This section assumes the user has an existing Jenkins installation configured to
use a Kubernetes cluster as the cloud via the
[kubernetes-plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin).
Furthermore, it's assumed that the GKE plugin has been installed either through
the [Plugin Manager](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/plugins/) or else
using the [SourceBuildInstallation](SourceBuildInstallation.md) guide. This
content provides guidance on changing the existing Kubernetes cloud
configuration to be compatible with the GKE plugin.

*   Within your Jenkins installation's web console, navigate to "Manage
    Jenkins" > "Configure System" > "Cloud" > "Images" > "Container"

*   Modify the "Docker image" field to: `gcr.io/jenkins-gke-plugin/jenkinsagent`

*   Ensure the "Name" field is: `jnlp`

*   For more responsive build executions, we suggest setting the "Time in
    minutes to retain agent when idle" field to atleast: `5`

## Installing using the Jenkins Helm chart

The [Jenkins](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/jenkins) chart
enables users to install Jenkins into a Kubernetes cluster using
[Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm). Included in the chart's configuration
values is the option to specify a set of Jenkins plugins to be installed by
default. This section provides guidance on utilizing this chart to install the
GKE plugin.

*   If installing into a cluster running within GKE, we suggest following Google
    Cloud Solutions'
    [tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/jenkins-on-kubernetes-engine-tutorial)
    for setting up Jenkins on GKE. **Note**: The chart version specified in the
    tutorial is out of date, we suggest users find a version which best suites
    their use-case.

*   Modify the `values.yaml` to be used when running `helm install --values` to
    include the following configuration values: `yaml Agent: Image:
    gcr.io/jenkins-gke-plugin/jenkinsagent ImageTag: latest Master:
    InstallPlugins: - google-kubernetes-engine:0.2.0`

See the [Dockerfile](../jenkinsagent/Dockerfile) for the
`gcr.io/jenkins-gke-plugin/jenkinsagent` image for more information.

through the helm chart after refactoring the Google Oauth Plugin.
